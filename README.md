# Partigon

To add Partigon to your project, see [Including Partigon in project](partigon/including-partigon-in-project.md) and [Adding to plugins folder](partigon/adding-to-plugins-folder.md).

To see what is possible with the library, see [Showcase](showcase.md).

To get started, see [Creating Particles](broken-reference). An example plugin is provided in [Tutorial](tutorial.md).
