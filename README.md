# Partigon

To add Partigon to your project, see [Including Partigon in project](partigon/including-partigon-in-project.md) and [Adding to plugins folder](partigon/adding-to-plugins-folder.md).

To see what is possible with the library, see [Examples](examples/).\
To get started, see [Creating Particles](broken-reference).



_Note: It is recommended to use Kotlin with Partigon, as it was made specifically for usage with Kotlin. Java support might come in the future, if there's demand for it._

All classes and methods have javadoc that provide more details and information.
