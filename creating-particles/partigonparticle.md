# PartigonParticle

`PartigonParticle` is an interface with basic methods that all other particle types implement:\
`start()` - Starts the particle animation from frame 0.\
`stop()` - Stops the particle animation.\
`resume()` - Resumes the particle animation from where it left off.

The ones you'll use are [SingularParticle](singularparticle.md) and [MultiParticle](multiparticle.md), but feel free to create your own implementations if needed.
