# Adding to plugins folder

To use this library, add the `Partigon.jar` file (found in [Releases](https://github.com/Gameoholic/Partigon/releases)) and `Kotlin.jar` (found [here](https://github.com/Gameoholic/PaperKotlin/releases)) to your plugins folder. Partigon requires the Kotlin stdlib to work.

Then, add Partigon as a [dependency or soft dependency](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/plugin-yml#dependencies) like any other plugin:

```html
depend: [ Partigon ]
```
