# TrigonometricEnvelope

An envelope for interpolation of 2 values via trigonometric functions, used for creating curves between points and circles.

An example of a Trigonometric Envelope:

`extra = TrigonometricEnvelope(1.envelope, 10.envelope, TrigFunc.SIN, RepeatLoop(40))`

It is usually preferred, however, to use Envelope Wrappers methods.
