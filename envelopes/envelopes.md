# Envelopes

Envelopes are how you customize particle animations and animate properties.\
An Envelope is essentially an interpolation of a value over time.\
An Envelope can control one property of the particle at a time. Some examples are: POS\_X, POS\_Y, POS\_Z, COUNT. _(for a full list, see `Envelope.PropertyType`)_

In Partigon, almost everything is an Envelope. Even the parameters that you pass into Envelopes, are Envelopes themselves.

All Envelopes have expressions, which are strings that are evaluated with [exp4j](https://github.com/fasseg/exp4j).

Envelopes can be nested inside of each other, resulting in unique effects that are otherwise not possible. In these cases, the property type will be `PropertyType.NONE`.

Most particle animations can be created using one of the already provided Envelope implementations, or using Envelope Wrappers.

All Envelopes extend BasicEnvelope, but you can create your own implementation.

All envelopes have a `completion` parameter, which indicates how much of the envelope to animate. For example, setting it to `1.0` will animate it in its entirety, `0.5` only half, `-1.0` will play it in reverse, etc.
